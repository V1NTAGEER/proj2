This is my object detection program that i spent a bunch of time on there were a bunch of challenges with this the first challenge i had was figuring out the synatax because i have never made anything like this before 
the second challenge was programing the whole camera thing which every time i think i got it figured out it just sends me an error i fix the error i get another one 
the third was figuring out the files because i didnt want to have to teach the computer what everything is and so i went to github to download something 
those were the main challenges i had more but for now thats all im going to say.
